# Madagascar – Tables

This folder contains CSV and XLSX outputs backing the figures and brief. Each
file is row-and-column tidy, ready for analysis or visualization.

> Tip: `TablesPack_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.xlsx` bundles the most commonly shared tables.
> The temporary Excel lock file `~$TablesPack_*.xlsx` can be ignored.

## Period contrasts (recent vs earlier 5-yr blocks)
- `period_contrasts_annual.csv`  
  Annual means by **scheme × village × year**, then **2018–22 vs baselines** with:
  Δ (recent − base), % change, Welch p, Hedges’ g, bootstrap 95% CIs.
- `period_contrasts_monthly.csv`  
  Same as above but at the **month-of-year** level (pooled within month across years).
- `period_diffs_annual_2018-22_vs_blocks.csv`  
  Convenience version of annual contrasts focused on 2018–22 vs each block.
- `period_diffs_monthly_2018-22_vs_blocks.csv`  
  Convenience version of monthly contrasts focused on 2018–22 vs each block.

## Long-term trends (1980–2024)
- `trends_annual_1980_2024.csv`  
  Annual series per **scheme × village** with trend stats: OLS slope/decade,
  p-value, Mann–Kendall τ and p, and Sen’s slope/decade.
- `trends_monthly_1980_2024.csv`  
  Same statistics but **separately for each calendar month**.

## Workability & disease metrics (daily → monthly/annual summaries)
- `T_yearly_workability_all_mean.csv`  
  Annual **mean workability (all hours)** per village.
- `T_yearly_palm_hours_mean.csv`  
  Annual **Phytophthora-favorable hours** (rule-based) per village.
- `T_loss_area_yearly_byvillage.csv`  
  Annual **loss-area** = Σ(100 − workability%) per village.
- `T_max_block70_histogram_byvillage.csv`  
  Counts of the **maximum contiguous hours ≥70% workability** per day.
- `T_shift_window_workability_monthly_byvillage.csv`  
  Monthly averages for **morning/midday/afternoon/night** workability windows.
- `T_schedulability_byvillage.csv`  
  Monthly **share of days** with **≥4 contiguous hours** at **≥70%** workability.
- `T_workability_distribution_monthly_byvillage.csv`  
  Monthly **P05/P25/P50/P75/P95** workability percentiles by village.
- `T_degree_hours_byvillage.csv`  
  Monthly averages of **degree-hours above 28/31 °C (WBGT)** by village and year.
- `T_degree_hours_climatology_dh28_dh31_byvillage.csv`  
  Monthly **climatology** (multi-year means) of degree-hours by village.
- `T_monthly_workability_day_clim_mean.csv`  
  Monthly climatology of **daytime workability (09–16 h)** by village.

## Bundled workbook(s)
- `TablesPack_20250918_1556.xlsx`  
  First consolidated export of the tables above (multiple sheets).
- `TablesPack_20250918_1558.xlsx`  
  Updated consolidated export (use the most recent timestamp).

## Data dictionary (key columns)
Common columns you’ll see across tables:
- `scheme` — mapping method (`idw4` or `nearest1`).
- `village` — `Mandena` or `Sarahandrano`.
- `year`, `month` — time keys (month is 1–12).
- Variables by type:  
  • **State:** `tmean_c`, `tmax_c`, `tmin_c`, `rh_mean`, `vpd_kpa`  
  • **Sums:** `ssrd_MJ_day`, `wbgt28_h`, `wbgt31_h`, `hot35_h`  
  • **Workability (examples):** `work_*`, `max_block70_h`, `loss_area`  
- Contrast stats: `delta`, `pct_change`, `hedges_g`, `p_welch`, `ci_low`, `ci_high`.
- Trend stats: `slope_decade_lm`, `p_lm`, `tau_mk`, `p_mk`, `sens_slope_decade`.

## Repro & provenance
- Generated by scripts under `analysis/madagascar` (see code headers for exact
  steps and versioned parameters).
- Bootstrap CIs are based on **block resampling of years**; see code for `B`.

## Glossary (quick)
- **Workability (%):** comfort score (higher = easier to work outdoors).  
- **VPD (kPa):** “thirstiness” of air; higher = drier feeling.  
- **Degree-hours:** accumulated heat above a threshold (28/31 °C WBGT).  
- **WBGT:** heat-stress index using temperature, humidity, sun, wind.
